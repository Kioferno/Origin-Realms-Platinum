Origin Realms Platinum is a resource pack that redesigns various vanilla Minecraft textures to match the Origin Realms art style, for example saplings matching OR tree saplings, frogs matching the OR frog, and much more.



This pack must override the Origin Realms resource pack with the [Server Pack Unlocker](https://modrinth.com/mod/server-pack-unlocker)Â in order to work.

Certain mobs require the [CEM mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-entity-models-cem) and [ETF](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-texture-features-fabric) to work.


**Terms of Use**

You may alter textures for personal use, but you are not allowed to distribute this pack.
